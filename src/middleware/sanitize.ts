 *              This ensures keys removed by sanitization (like $ne) don't linger on the original object.
 * @param target - The target object or array
 * @param source - The source object or array
 * @example
 * Before:
 * req.query = { price: { $gte: '1000' }, page: '2' }
 *
 * After sanitize clone:
 * { price: {}, page: '2' } (the $gte key is removed)
 *
 * replaceInPlace:
 * Deletes old keys from req.query, then assigns sanitized
 * keys â†’ req.query (same reference) now equals { price: {}, page: '2' }.
